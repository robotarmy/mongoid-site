.text
  A <tt>Mongoid::Document</tt> can have associations to other documents through 3 traditional
  ActiveRecord-style macros: <tt>embeds_one</tt>, <tt>embeds_many</tt> and <tt>embedded_in</tt>.
  When setting up associations, one document will act as the root for all other objects in the
  graph, and all associations will be <i>embedded</i> within that root document in the graph
  as well as the database itself. Relational associations to documents in other collections
  are not handled by these macros, as it is against the general reasoning for choosing to use
  a non-relational data store. Relational associations are described at the bottom.

  %br
  %br
  Considering the person model from previous examples, associations to other documents would
  be set up like so:

  %br
  %br
  <tt>person.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :first_name
          field :last_name
          embeds_one :address
          embeds_many :phones
        end

  <tt>address.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Address
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :street
          field :city
          field :state
          field :post_code
          embedded_in :person, :inverse_of => :address
        end

  <tt>phone.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Phone
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :country_code, :type => Integer, :default => 1
          field :number
          embedded_in :person, :inverse_of => :phones
        end

  Given the above models, an example person saved to the database would have this structure in BSON,
  where a <tt>embeds_one</tt> gets embedded as a hash and a <tt>embeds_many</tt> gets embedded as an
  array of hashes.

  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        {
          first_name: "Durran",
          last_name: "Jordan",
          address: {
            street: "30 Rockefeller Plaza",
            city: "New York",
            state: "NY",
            post_code: "10112"
          },
          phones: [ { country_code: 1, number: "212-555-1212" } ]
        }

  Associations may have options associated with them, the most important of which is the <i>required</i>
  option of <tt>inverse_of</tt> on a <tt>embedded_in</tt> association. In order to properly set up the
  relationships and make sure the object graph is always up to date with any modifications to any object,
  the <tt>embedded_in</tt> association must provide this option (and be present itself). The value should
  be set to the name of the association in its parent object. In addition, a <tt>class_name</tt> option
  may be provided if the name of the association differs from a singular or plural form of the document's
  class name. We can modify the examples above to show what an updated person would look like with the
  phones association name changed:

  %br
  %br
  <tt>person.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :first_name
          field :last_name
          embeds_one :address
          embeds_many :phone_numbers, :class_name => "Phone"
        end

  %br
.title Building and Creating Associations
.text
  Associations can be set directly, appended to, built, or created in certain cases:

  %br
  %br
  <tt>embeds_one</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        person = Person.new

        person.build_address(:street => "Oxford Street")
        person.create_address(:street => "Oxford Street")
        person.address = Address.new(:street => "Oxford Street")

  <tt>embeds_many</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        person = Person.new

        person.phone_numbers.build(:number => "415-555-1212")
        person.phone_numbers.create(:number => "415-555-1212")
        person.phone_numbers &lt;&lt; Phone.new(:number => "415-555-1212")
        person.phone_numbers = [ Phone.new(:number => "415-555-1212") ]

  <tt>embedded_in</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        address = Address.new
        address.person = Person.new(:first_name => "Mark")

  %br
.title Polymorphic Associations
.text
  By default, all <tt>embedded_in</tt> associations are polymorphic. No matter what name you provide
  to the macro it will always return the parent object. You may provide the <tt>:polymorphic => true</tt>
  option if you like as a "security blanket", but it will actually do nothing extra. An example of
  this given the above models would be:

  %br
  %br
  <tt>address.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Address
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :street
          field :city
          field :state
          field :post_code
          embedded_in :addressable, :inverse_of => :address
        end

  In the above example, address.addressable would actually return the parent object, which is the Person.

.title Association Extensions
.text
  Mongoid supports anonymous association extensions, that have access to the proxied target
  via the target instance variable.

  %br
  %br
  <tt>person.rb</tt>:
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          field :name
          embeds_many :addresses do
            def california
              @target.select { |address| address.state == "CA" }
            end
          end
        end

  In the above example, person.addresses.california would return only CA addresses.

  %br
  %br
.title Relational Associations
.text
  Mongoid supports basic relational associations to documents in another collection, or objects
  that reside in another database. The related object must support ActiveRecord style finders
  in order for the association to work. The 3 macros provided are <tt>has_one_related</tt>,
  <tt>has_many_related</tt>, and <tt>belongs_to_related</tt>. When using the macros an id
  field will be created on the object that is on the <tt>belongs_to_related</tt> side of the association.

  %br
  %br
  <tt>person.rb</tt>
  %pre
    %code.language-ruby
      :preserve
        class Person
          include Mongoid::Document
          has_one_related :policy
          has_many_related :prescriptions
        end

        class Policy
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to_related :person
        end

        class Prescription
          include Mongoid::Document
          belongs_to_related :person
        end

        person = Person.create
        policy = Policy.create
        prescription = Prescription.create

        person.policy = policy
        person.prescriptions = [prescription]
